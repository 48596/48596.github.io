      <h1> <center> This is what a basic, minimal HTML page would look like </center> </h1>
        <p> If you want to change the font size, then you use the "< font >" syntax. It will look <font size="6"> this</font>.
          <br> You can also change colors using the same "< font >" syntax. <font size="7" color="green"> Like this </font>
          <br> Or you can change the font itself, <font face="comic sans ms" size = "5"> like this using Comic Sans MS</font>
          <br> <font size="4" face="impact" color="blue"> In order to set the font, size and color to what this sentence is in,</font>
          This line is used, "< font size="4" face="impact" color="blue" > (Insert output here) < /font >".
          <br> If you noticed, I used "< /font>"" at the end, that is to close the setting.
          <br> You must do this in for all syntaxes as everything has to be closed just like Java brackets, {}.
          <br> Lastly, you have noticed that the background is different, it is colored. Code used, <b>"style="background-color:lightgreen"".</b> which
          is implemented into the < body > syntax, where "body" means visible text or image.
          <br> Anything outside will be defining what text looks like and how it is structured.
